# movie-recommender-system
A content-based movie recommender system built with Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. The system suggests movies similar to a selected title by analyzing features from the TMDB dataset. Posters are fetched dynamically using the TMDB API, and results are displayed in an interactive Streamlit web app.
